<h1>Idea and Prototype</h1>
While experimenting with Python and pygame in 2019 I made what would be the prototype for this game. The game world is represented by a 3-dimensional array, vertices are projected to the screen and using <i>pygame.gfxdraw.filled_polygon</i> it was easy to get a simple 3d world drawn to screen. All surfaces are a solid colored and there's no lighting engine.
The game at this point ran with python at about 80fps. All movements are discreete, so the game is playable on a 10fps framerate at this point. Originally I used a fixed isometric perspective, but by keeping track of the projection of three basis vector it was possible to allow for rotation and zooming of the game-world allowing for any orthographic perspective 
(meaning an infinitely zoomed in view from infinitely far away, making all blocks look the same size regardless of the distance to the camera).

Above is a picture of the level containing the gate to hell in the python version (left) and an early version of the c++ version (right). The main differance is the lighting engine and that some blocks are textured. The c++ version still runs at a higher fps.

<h1>Graphics Engine</h1>
The first step when moving to C++ was to make the graphics engine, and to make it fast. Using something highly optimized like OpenGL would give the best results here, but wanting to learn how things works I decided to write the engine from scratch.

<h2>Screen Buffer</h2>
The pixels that are drawn to screen every frame is stored in an array of size screen_width*screen_height. Each pixels is represented by an unsigned 32-bit integer. This corresponds to a color, if a pixel value is 10ff2a (in hex) this corresponds to an RGB-color value of (10,ff,2a)=(16,255,42). This uses only 24 of the 32 bits, but is still a good way to do this considering how sequential bits of memory are read.

<h2>Projection</h2>
All game objects are represented by 3d-vectors, with the basic block being of size 1x1x1. To draw these 3d objects on a 2d screen we need a mathematical projection formula pr: R^3->R^2. To do this I keep track of the projection of the basis vectors E1=(1,0,0), E2=(0,2,0), E3=(0,0,1). Let e1,e2,e3 be the projection of these. For example, an isometric perspective corresponds to
e1=(sqrt(3)/2,-1/2), e2=(-sqrt(3)/2,-1/2), e3=(sqrt(3)/2,-1/2). Then since orthographic projections are linear we can simply let pr(x,y,z):=x*e1+y*e2+z*e3, and only recalculate e1,e2,e3 when the perspective is changed.

<h2>Drawing polygons</h2>
With the projection function in hand we can draw a block at (x,y,z) drawing its siz surfaces as filled polygons. For example, the top surface of the block has corners in game world coordinates (x,y,z+1),(x+1,y,z+1),(x+1,y+1,z+1),(x,y+1,z+1), so by projecting these four points we get the corresponding polygon corners on the 2d-screen. We still need primitive functions to actually draw a solid-colored 4gon on the screen though.
To draw a line parallell to the x axis, we simply loop through all the corresponding pixels in the pixel buffer and change the values to the appropriate color. A triangle on screen with one side parallell to the x-axis has corners in (x0,y0), (x1,y1), (x2,y2) where y0=y1. These can be drawn by drawing a line at each y-coordinate between y0 and y2, the start and endpoints being expressible in an algebraic expression in x0,x1,x2,y0,y2. 
Any triangle can be split into two trianges of the form above (split it with a line parallell to the x-axis through the vertex with y-coordinate between the other two y-coordinates min(max(y1,y2),y3)). Finally any 4gon can be split into 2 triangles (or generally, any n-gon can be split into n-1 triangles), so this allows us to draw block faces to screen. 
The game also has primitive functions to draw 3d-lines, spheres, cones, and cylinders - the projections of these consist of basic elements like circles, ellipses, lines and triangles.</body>

<h2>Textures</h2>
Textures are stored in a single atlas.bmp image, and loaded on boot into a pixel buffer. An array of texture-struct keeps track of the locations and sizes of textures within the atlas. A texture typically is a 32x32 square which will be projected onto a block surface. To achieve this, when we have projected the four corners to the screen we get 4 screen coordinates. Let us assume the first corner is (0,0), otherwise we can apply a simple translation.
If the corners of the 4-gon are (0,0),(x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x1+x2,y1+y2), we note that the linear transformation f:(x,y)->x*(x1,y1)+y*(x2,y2) maps the unit square [0,1]x[0,1] to the given polygon, so its inverse f^{-1} maps the polygon on screen to the unit square, and 32*f^{-1} maps a point inside the polygon to the corresponding pixel in the texture (here one has to be careful about rounding issues).

<p style="width:50%"><i>Some early experiments with textures.</i></p></center>

<h2>Optimizations</h2>
Drawing textures this way using the CPU is expensive and lowers fps significantly, on the other hand this looks a lot better than solid colored blocks. A first optimization is achieved by noting that in any orthographic projection of a block, we only need to draw the three surfaces that faces the camera. To do this one need only to keep track of which octant the camera is in (meaning the sign of the x,y,z coordinates of the camera). This halves the cpu required. Another thing to note is
 that in a typical level, many blocks are obscured and will not need to be drawn. Although its complicated to compute exactly which blocks are completely obscured, we note at (x,y,z) is definitely partly obscured if there are blocks at (x+1,y,z), (x-1,y,z), (x,y+1,z),.. and so on. Ignoring such block sides saves a lot of cpu-time on levels containing large chunks of land, lika mountains.

<h1>Blocks, shapes, and physics</h1>
The basic element of the game is the "Block" - a 1x1x1 solid shape. It has integral (x,y,z) coordinates, and textures or colors on each side. Blocks also has attributes, they can come as solid, static, floating, destructible. Some blocks can be keys or doors. A collection of blocks can be stuck together forming a "Shape", like a tetris piece. Blocks are structs stored in an array, a Shapes is simply a container of references to such blocks. The game needs to handle pushing shapes, this is handled
 by a recursive algorithm that checks wheather adjacent blocks in the push-direction are blocked or free to move. If a block is about to move, all blocks on top of it should also slide along if they are not blocked. This leads to some dilemmas on how to define movement, for example, if a shape rests on two other shapes and one of those shapes move, should the top shape move along? In the end I decided that the answer should be yes, it looks unrealistic in some cases but I would prioritize consistency of game mechanics over absolute realism.
 There's also gravity, blocks fall down quickly if there is no supporting block under them. This also leads to some problems, for example, two shapes can support each other, like two connected C-shaped blocks.

<h1>Draw order</h1>
A major difficulty is the order in which blocks and game elements are drawn on screen. An advanced engine like openGL has algorithms running on the GPU to compute intersections of polygons. For me I cannot split polygons into distinct drawable objects. Luckily, as long as blocks are kept to a grid, given any two blocks overlapping on the screen, one will always be in front of the other.
This is more complicated for shapes consisting of several blocks. For example three long shapes A,B,C parallell to the three coordinate axises respectively could be arranged in such A>B>C>A (where > means "is in front of"). For reasons such as this, shapes are drawn block by block.
Although all movement is on a discrete integer grid I added a sliding animation to make it look smoother, this causes some major problems in the draw-order of blocks. In the end the final algorithm works roughly like this when the camera is in the first octant: a) Cut the level into slices where the x+y+z in each slice is constant (corresponing to planes orthogontal to the vector (1,1,1). Then take all blocks currently moving and sort them between the corresponding slices, 
for example a block at position (4,3.7,2) should be drawn between the layers corresponding to x+y+z=9 and the layer where x+y+z=10.

<h1>Lighting Engine</h1>
A light-source is a struct having several attributes. The basic are (x,y,z) position, color, and intensity. But lights can also pulsate with different colors and intensity, they can rotate around a point (allowing for fireflies, or a night and day cycle for example). Some lights are directed, meaning they only shine in a cone, and some lights are ambient, meaning that they only take into account distance to surfaces, not direction of the lightbeam relative to the surface normal, allowing for smoother light. Normal lights illuminates surfaces with intensity corresponding to the square of the distance to the light source.
 Some lights are special, where this square can be modified to any real number (in reality this could be observed if there is fog or dust in the air). Lights can also be attached to blocks, allowing players to carry lamps etc. The game looks a lot better with this engine, but it is quite cpu-costly. Early versions saved the lighting levels of blocks to reduce cpu drain, but current versions update all lighting every frame which looks a lot better when lights are moving. 
In the end I went with the latter, the end result looks a bit muddy since Dantes purple clothes will look brownish in the red light, but to me it looks more realistic.
<center><img width="50%" src="img/torus.gif"><p style="width:50%"><i>Early experiments to make sure that distance and angles interacts properly with the different colored surfaces.</i></p></center>

Being able to quicly change light intensity and colors makes it very easy to change the look and feel of a level. Some design decisions also had to be considered - for example, I wanted the whole circle of Fraud to be fiery red - should the blocks themselves be red (meaning they only reflect red light) or should they be lit only with red colored light?

<h1>Saving Levels</h1>
In the early python version I used a pickle-library to quickly serialize game objects and store them into files, which was quick and easy. Here I had to write my own serialization algorithms. The choice stood between binary or text format. In the end I went with text-files since it is easier to debug errors when you can read exactly what is in the file.
There is some problem when saving shapes consisting of several blocks as one has to keep track of this tree-like relationship when saving and loading. The map-file consists of several keywords, for example here is a few lines from a level file:<br>
<br>
<i>shape 1 1<br>
0  0 0 0<br>
block 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2105408 2105408 2105408 2105408 2105408 2105408 0 0 0 0 0 0<br>
block 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 2105408 2105408 2105408 2105408 2105408 2105408 0 0 0 0 0 0<br>
end_shape<br><br></i>

This corresponds to a shape which is unpushable, and unaffected by gravity. It consists of two blocks with coordinates (0,0,0) and (0,1,0) respectively, there are no ladders on either block, and all sides are colored rather than textured, the color of each side corresponds to the value 2105408 when translated to hex. So roughly there is one line for each block of the level, making files of about 2000 blocks on average.
The game also saves data about the lights, weather effects, and some metadata, and the poem-text associated to the level in a similar formats. Most level files are around 100kb, which can be loaded by the deserialization algorithm almost instantly.

<h1>Level editor</h1>
In order to be able to make 100 levels I wanted to make an editor which was very user friendly and which didn't require modification of files outside the game. It took a long time to make this editor, making sliders, buttons, positioning everything consistently, and dealing with bugs. The editor is still not perfect and I do not plan to include it in the release version as it still uses a console for some text inputs.
The thing that really sped up the level editing speed was the addition of being able to click on a surface with the mouse. This allowed rectangular selection and quick drawing of textures on surfaces. The problem is that the mouse position on screen typically overlaps several surfaces, so the game constructs an inverse to the projection function that computes a set of all possible surfaces clicked on, then it returns the one closest to the camera. 
Here is what the editor looked like some time into development:
<center><img width="80%" src="img/edit_mode.jpg"></center>
There are five modes, selecting multiple positions by drawing rectangles, selecting by clicking, the paint-modes to paint surfaces or full blocks, and Light edit mode. In block-paint-mode, the clicked or selected blocks are pained the same as the surfaces of the pre colored fold-out cube in the center left, which you can edit before painting. There are also buttons for merging blocks into shapes, setting shapes as pushable, adding text and so on.
In light edit mode most of the menu changes.

<h1>Font</h1>
It turns out that it is hard to make a good looking font from scratch. I wanted a mono-spaced font to make things easy. I started by making a minimal font where each letter consisted of 7x4 pixels forming capital lettesr. This is used only in the editor and when displaying compact data such as fps. Here each letter is simply an array of 7*4=28 bits corresponding to pixels. Theres also a draw function for simply multiplying the size by an integer, which makes it easy to make large but terrible-looking letters.
I then used the same idea to make a larger font of size 15x20 which is used for the in game menu and for the lines of Dante's poem. The font still looks jagged and weird without kerning so there's room for improvement.

<h1>Background blur</h1>
Originally the background was always black which looked pretty good. My idea was to instead have the background follow roughly the same color scheme as the level itself. I ended up designing a background similar to how some photos and videos with black borders are filled up: by using a very blurred version of the image itself.
To do this I wrote a gaussian blur filter which uses three box-blurs in the x and y direction respectively. This is far to slow to do every frame, so on level load the level is zoomed in to cover most of the screen, the filter is applied, and the pixeldata is saved in a secondary buffer which is copied into the main buffer every frame, this all happens in about 20ms on level load and is invisible to the user.
I like the look of this blur effect, but the black color had a certain simplicity to it, so I kept it as an option.

<h1>Game Menu</h1>
I wanted the game menu to be easy to use, many things should be configurable, and the effects should be clearly visible or demonstrated when changing options. The options menu looks like this:
<center><img width="80%" src="img/menu_show.jpg"></center>
Here the text on the top of the screen explains what the hovered option does. Clicking fancy backgrounds will immediately set the background to black so the user can decide what to use without leaving the menu.
Since the menu is overlaid upon the game, I wanted the text to have good contrast. Therefore the menu text changes depending on the Circle of Hell. In the picture above we are in the Circle of Fraud which has a red theme, therefore the color scheme of the menu is set in orange-yellow. <br><br>

There is also a level-select screen. Here I wanted to use thumbnails rather than names to make it easy for the user to recognize and find an old level. 
<center><img width="80%" src="img/level_select.jpg"></center>
This image is generated by an algorithm that sequentially loads all levels, zooms out a lot, and copies the miniature level into the corresponding position of a pixel buffer, and saves this image as a bmp. This algorithm takes a couple of seconds to run so it is only done before publishing new versions of the game.


<h1>Music</h1>
Music is the one thing I did not do myself, instead I use around 60 tracks of royalty free music found online. Each circle of inferno has its own collection of 5-10 songs trying to match the general mood of the scenes. Typically songs get more tense and oppressive the deeper you go.

<h1>Art</h1>
Throughout the ages artists have made depictions of scenes from Dante's Inferno. Luckily most of these are old enough to be in the public domain. My favourit are Gustave Dore's wood engravings. Since these are black and white I decided to color them for the game. 
I used the Krita software to draw a color layer and combined it by the "multiply" which was surprisingly easy. Still it took many hours, and in total I colored around 50 of these images. Being able to chose colors also had the benefit of letting me match the colors to the actual colors of the levels in the game.

Since many levels of hell are red I decided to go with purple clothing for my Dante.</i></p></center>


<h1>Dictionary</h1>
Early playtests indicated that the old Longfellow translations - though charming - may be to hard to understand for some audiances. Therefore I added a dictionary containing 600 words and phrases. User can hover words in the level intro to read an explanation. The dictionary also provides short info on the historical and mythological persons Dante meets on his journey, like Virgil, Cleopatra, Minos, Cairon, Trisan, count Ugolino etc.

<h1>Steam Integration</h1>
I decided to experiment with some light steam integration after finishing the game. Currently there are progress-achievements, one for each circle, but I plan to add some more interesting achievements, like solving a level in a certain number of moves to add a bit of replayability. Using the steam library does mean including another library, but on the other hand this doesn't really effect gameplay.
The sad part about writing the graphics library myself is that I cannot get the achievement to pop up on screen when achieved, although I could do this in a custom way later.
