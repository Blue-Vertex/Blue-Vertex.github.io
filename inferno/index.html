<h1>Story</h1>
<h4>
<p>
Inferno is based on Dante Alighieri's poem "Inferno" from his trilogy and magnum opus "The Divine Comedy". In Inferno Dante descends though the nine circles of Hell where he meets figures from his life in Florence as well as persons from Greek and Roman mythology.
</p>
</h4>
<h1>Gameplay</h1>
<h4>
<p>
The game starts out by Socoban style box-pushing mechanics. A design goal was to have each of the ~100 puzzles to be unique, with each level introducing some new idea. Each of the nine circles of hell comes with its own game mechanic.
<ul>
<li>Forest - pushing blocks</li>
<li>Circle I - Limbo - manipulating ladders</li>
<li>Circle II - Lust - locks and keys</li>
<li>Circle III - Gluttony - manipulating rolling souls</li>
<li>Circle IV - Greed - manipulating marching souls</li>
<li>Circle V - Wrath - manipulating light sources</li>
<li>Circle VI - Heresy - classical physical puzzles implemented in the game engine</li>
<li>Circle VII - Violence - switching between two characters to solve co-op puzzles</li>
<li>Circle VIII - Fraud - handling destructible blocks</li>
<li>Circle IX - Treachery - constructing logical circuits by combining all previous mechanics</li>
</ul>

<h1>Art and Litterature</h1>
<h4>
<p>Between levels quotes from "Inferno" are shown to the player. These come from the Longfellow translation, I chose this one because it is in the public domain and I like the sound of the old english language and the mood it brings.
Coupled with the quotes are artwork. These are mostly Gustave Dore's famous wood engravings from the 18 centuary, colorized by me.

The game includes a dictionary explaining some uncommon words, it also gives brief intro on historical persons Dante meets.

<h1>Development</h1>
<h4>
<p>I started this project to learn c++ - my goal was to do the game from scratch without any external libraries. Development went relatively fast, I had a more or less complete game in 3 months: one month for the code, one month for making the levels, and one music, art, game menu, font, steam integration etc. Since then I've been polishing the game.
